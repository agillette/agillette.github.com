Jekyll is great. I've been using it in my workflow for clients for some time now, and only just getting around to setting up my own blog with it. If you haven't been using Jekyll because you're a designer, or a front-end person who is terrified of command line, please go read [this excellent article](https://medium.com/@katiekovalcin/a-not-super-technical-designers-command-line-toolbox-3b5804149430){:target="_blank"}. The lines that used to distinguish design from ux from front-end from back-end have been steadily blurring for some time now. It's just a fact of this new world that you need to be familiar with a little bit of everything and if you're not leveraging the power CLI tools you're falling behind.

In the coming weeks I'll be blogging a bit about what I do and why I do it. I love the internet and I love learning new tricks. If you'd like to know a little more about me check out the [about page](/about).
