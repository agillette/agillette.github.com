I am a technologist whose work tends to focus on front-end development for web and mobile. I try to spend at least 25% of my time learning new languages, tools and approaches. Sometimes I write and talk about design, technology, sustainability and the future. I am the co-founder of Brooklyn-based digital studio [We &lt;3](http://welessthanthree.com). I am co-host and -organizer of a monthly peer lecture series called [Presentation Party Night](http://presentationpartynight.com) and a founding member of [Bushwick Happy Hour](http://bushwickhappyhour.com). Sometimes I think that social media is a set of great, powerful tools that I should use more often, and sometimes I think it is the killer of productivity and pat myself on the back for not spending too much time on it. If you're so inclined I am either on or pretending not to be on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/andy.gillette.33), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/agillette), [Instagram](http://instagram.com/andygillette), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/pub/andy-gillette/3/b27/674/) and whatever new, cool thing everyone else is on right now.
